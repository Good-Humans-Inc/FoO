# FoodStickerJarApp Onboarding
## 1. Overview

FoodStickerJarApp is a SwiftUI application that allows users to take pictures of food, automatically turn them into "stickers" with a white outline, and drop them into a virtual "jar." The stickers in the jar interact with each other using a 2D physics engine (SpriteKit) and respond to the device's motion. Tapping on a sticker reveals details about the food item, including its name, a fun fact, and nutritional information, which are fetched from a backend service.

## 2. Architecture

The app is built using a modern SwiftUI approach, primarily following the **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** design pattern. For features that are not natively available in SwiftUI, the app uses `UIViewRepresentable` and `UIViewControllerRepresentable` to bridge UIKit and SpriteKit components.

### Core Components:

*   **Views (SwiftUI):** The UI is built entirely in SwiftUI. Key views include `HomeView` (the main screen), `FoodDetailView` (shows sticker info), and `ImageProcessingView` (handles the camera and sticker creation flow).
*   **ViewModels (`HomeViewModel`):** This is the central hub of the application's logic. It manages the state, communicates with services, and provides data to the views via Combine publishers (`@Published` properties).
*   **Models (`FoodItem`, `FoodInfo`):** Simple `Codable` structs that represent the application's data.
*   **Services:** A suite of services handles distinct responsibilities like authentication, database interaction, and physics simulation. This keeps the `HomeViewModel` clean and focused.
*   **SwiftUI -> SpriteKit Bridge:** The `SpriteView` (`UIViewControllerRepresentable`) hosts the `JarScene` (`SKScene`) within the SwiftUI view hierarchy, allowing the physics simulation to be a seamless part of the UI.

## 4. Core Features & Data Flow

### Sticker Creation Flow

This is the primary feature of the app. The process is optimized for a fast user experience by running tasks in parallel.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant IV as ImageProcessingView
    participant HVM as HomeViewModel
    participant FS as FirestoreService
    participant FAS as FoodAnalysisService

    User->>IV: Takes a photo
    IV->>IV: Extracts food subject from photo (using VisionKit)
    IV->>HVM: onComplete(stickerImage)
    HVM->>HVM: Sets loading state (isSavingSticker = true)
    
    par
        HVM->>FS: createSticker(image)
        FS->>Firebase Storage: Uploads full image & thumbnail
        Firebase Storage-->>FS: Returns URLs
        FS->>Firestore: Creates document with image URLs
        Firestore-->>FS: Confirms creation
        FS-->>HVM: Returns initial FoodItem
    and
        HVM->>FAS: analyzeFoodImage(image)
        FAS->>Cloud Function: Sends image data
        Cloud Function-->>FAS: Returns FoodInfo (name, facts)
        FAS-->>HVM: Returns analysis result
    end

    HVM->>HVM: Shows FoodDetailView with initial FoodItem (UI is now responsive)
    HVM->>FS: updateSticker(foodInfo)
    FS->>Firestore: Merges analysis data into document
    HVM->>HVM: Updates FoodDetailView with full details
    User->>FoodDetailView: Dismisses view
    FoodDetailView->>HVM: onDismiss()
    HVM->>JarScene: addSticker(finalFoodItem)
    JarScene->>JarScene: Animates sticker falling into jar
```

### The Physics Jar

-   **SpriteKit & `JarScene`:** The jar is a `SKScene`. It uses a physics world with gravity that is influenced by the device's accelerometer (`CMMotionManager`), allowing the user to "shake" the stickers around.
-   **Boundaries:** An invisible, non-rectangular boundary (`SKPhysicsBody(edgeLoopFrom: path)`) matching the shape of the jar image keeps the stickers contained.
-   **Stickers:** Each sticker is an `SKSpriteNode`. Its physics body is generated from the sticker's texture for accurate collision detection.
-   **Interaction:** The scene detects taps on stickers and uses a Combine `PassthroughSubject` (`onStickerTapped`) to notify the `HomeViewModel` which sticker was selected.

## 5. Dependencies

The app relies on a few key third-party libraries managed via Swift Package Manager:

-   **Firebase:**
    -   `FirebaseAuth`: For user authentication.
    -   `FirebaseFirestore`: For the main database.
    -   `FirebaseFirestoreSwift`: For `Codable` support with Firestore.
    -   `FirebaseStorage`: For storing all sticker images.
-   **Kingfisher:** A powerful library for downloading and caching images from the web. It's used in `JarScene` to load sticker thumbnails and in `FoodDetailView` for the full-resolution image.

## 6. Getting Started

To build and run the project, you will need:

1.  **Xcode:** The latest version is recommended.
2.  **Firebase Project:**
    -   Create a new project on the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    -   Add an iOS app to the project.
    -   Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file provided during the setup.
    -   **Place `GoogleService-Info.plist` in the `FoodStickerJarApp/FoodStickerJarApp/` directory.** (It's included in the `.gitignore`, so you'll need to add it yourself).
    -   Enable the following Firebase services:
        -   **Authentication:** Enable the "Email/Password" sign-in method.
        -   **Firestore:** Create a new database. You will need to set up the security rules to allow authenticated users to read/write their own data.
        -   **Storage:** Create a new storage bucket.
3.  **Backend Cloud Function:**
    -   The `FoodAnalysisService` points to a deployed Google Cloud Function. You will need to deploy your own version of this function (the source code is in the `backend` directory) or get the URL from a team member.
    -   Update the `cloudFunctionURLString` in `FoodAnalysisService.swift` with your function's trigger URL.
4.  **Build & Run:** Open the `.xcodeproj` file and run the app on a simulator or physical device.
